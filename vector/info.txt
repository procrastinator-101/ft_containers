resize, insert :
	-	if the type of the elements is either copyable or no-throw moveable --> no change, no throw
	-	otherwise : valid state


assign :
	-	valid state

= :

valid state:
	-	each element from 0 to _size is defined
	_	allocation failure for non-constructors
		-	size = 0;
		-	capacity = 0



checked :
	-	resize
	-	reserve





done :
	-	capacity
	-	elements acces
	-	relational operators



insert : copy construct the last element at the end and then make arr[i] = arr[i - 1] until you reach 'position'
		 and then assign val to it.
