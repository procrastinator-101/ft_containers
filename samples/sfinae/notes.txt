		-	void
		-	reference
		-	function
		-	negative size
		-	non-integral
		-	size zero
	*	attempting to use a type on the left of a scope resolution operator :: and it is not a class or enumeration.
	*	attempting to use a member of a type, where:
		-	the type does not contain the specified member
		-	the specified member is not a type where a type is required
		-	the specified member is not a template where a template is required
		-	the specified member is not a non-type where a non-type is required
	*	attempting to create a pointer to reference
	*	attempting to create a reference to void

	*	attempting to perform an invalid conversion in
		-	in a template argument expression
		-	in an expression used in function declaration
	*	attempting to create a function type with a parameter of type void
	*	attempting to create a function type which returns an array type or a function type
